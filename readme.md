# Deep Learning in Computer Vision and Text Mining
This repository contains resources for studying deep learning in computer vision and text mining.

## Computer Vision
### Image Classification
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are a class of deep neural networks that are widely used for image classification tasks. CNNs are composed of multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. Some popular CNN architectures include AlexNet, VGG, ResNet, and InceptionNet.

### Transfer Learning
Transfer learning is a technique that involves reusing pre-trained models on new tasks. Fine-tuning a pre-trained model can yield better performance than training a model from scratch. Some popular pre-trained models for image classification tasks include ImageNet, VGG, and ResNet.

### Object Detection
Region-based CNNs (RCNN)
Region-based CNNs (RCNN) are a class of CNNs that are used for object detection tasks. RCNNs are composed of multiple stages, including region proposal, feature extraction, and classification. Some popular RCNN architectures include Faster RCNN, Mask RCNN, and Cascade RCNN.

### Semantic Segmentation
Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN)
Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN) are a class of CNNs that are used for semantic segmentation tasks. FCNs are composed of multiple layers, including convolutional layers and transposed convolutional layers. Some popular FCN architectures include U-Net, Deeplab, and PSPNet.

## Text Mining
### Text Classification
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are a class of deep neural networks that are used for text classification tasks. RNNs are composed of multiple layers, including recurrent layers and fully connected layers. Some popular RNN architectures include Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU).

### Transfer Learning
Transfer learning is also widely used in text classification tasks. Fine-tuning a pre-trained model can yield better performance than training a model from scratch. Some popular pre-trained models for text classification tasks include Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT, GPT.

### Named Entity Recognition
Conditional Random Fields (CRF) are a class of statistical models that are used for named entity recognition tasks. CRFs are trained on labeled data to learn the relationships between words and named entities in text.

## Conclusion
Deep learning is a powerful technique that can be used for a variety of computer vision and text mining tasks. Understanding the underlying principles of deep learning models and their architectures is essential for achieving good performance on these tasks. Transfer learning is a useful technique for improving performance on new tasks, and pre-trained models are widely available for various computer vision and text mining tasks.
